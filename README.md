## Branching Strategy

This project uses a two-branch workflow:

### Branches

- **`main`** - Production-ready code. Protected branch, requires PR approval.
- **`dev`** - Active development branch. All feature branches merge here first.

### Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   # Make changes, commit
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   # Create PR to dev branch
   ```

2. **Release to Production**
   ```bash
   # After testing in dev
   git checkout main
   git merge dev
   git push origin main
   # Triggers production deployment
   ```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions:**
- Runs on all PRs to `dev` and `main`
- `dev` branch: Runs tests, builds artifacts
- `main` branch: Runs tests, builds, deploys to production (if configured)

**TeamCity:**
- Configure VCS trigger for `dev` branch: Run tests and deploy to staging
- Configure VCS trigger for `main` branch: Run tests and deploy to production
- Branch specification: `+:refs/heads/(dev|main)`

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+ (or use Docker)
- AWS CLI (for cloud deployments)
- Make (optional, for convenience)

### Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd blandmockapi

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run with example configuration
go run ./cmd/server -config ./examples

# Or use Make
make run
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### Test the API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# REST endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users

# GraphQL query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ users { id name email } }"}'
```

## Configuration

### TOML Structure

Create `.toml` files in your config directory with the following structure:

#### Server Configuration

```toml
[server]
port = 8080              # Port number to listen on (1-65535)
host = "0.0.0.0"         # Interface to bind to ("0.0.0.0" = all interfaces, "localhost" = local only)
read_timeout = 15        # Maximum duration in SECONDS for reading the entire request (headers + body)
write_timeout = 15       # Maximum duration in SECONDS for writing the response
```

**Server Configuration Details:**

- **`port`** (integer, default: `8080`)
  - The TCP port the server listens on
  - Valid range: 1-65535
  - Use ports > 1024 to avoid requiring root/admin privileges
  - Common choices: 8080, 3000, 8000

- **`host`** (string, default: `"0.0.0.0"`)
  - Network interface to bind to
  - `"0.0.0.0"` - Listen on all network interfaces (accessible from other machines)
  - `"localhost"` or `"127.0.0.1"` - Only accept local connections
  - Specific IP - Bind to a particular network interface

- **`read_timeout`** (integer, default: `15`)
  - **Unit: SECONDS**
  - Maximum time allowed to read the entire HTTP request
  - Includes time to read headers AND body
  - Prevents slow-client attacks (Slowloris)
  - Recommended: 10-30 seconds for most APIs
  - Increase if clients send large request bodies
  - Example: `read_timeout = 30` allows up to 30 seconds for request

- **`write_timeout`** (integer, default: `15`)
  - **Unit: SECONDS**
  - Maximum time allowed to write the HTTP response
  - Includes time from end of request read to finish of response write
  - Prevents connections from staying open too long
  - Recommended: 10-30 seconds for most APIs
  - Increase if responses are very large or if using large `delay` values
  - Example: `write_timeout = 60` allows up to 60 seconds for response

**Timeout Configuration Examples:**

```toml
# Development environment - generous timeouts
[server]
read_timeout = 60
write_timeout = 60

# Production environment - strict timeouts
[server]
read_timeout = 10
write_timeout = 10

# Large file uploads/downloads
[server]
read_timeout = 300   # 5 minutes
write_timeout = 300  # 5 minutes

# Testing slow endpoints with delays
[server]
read_timeout = 15
write_timeout = 30   # Must be > max endpoint delay
```

#### REST Endpoints

```toml
[[endpoints]]
path = "/api/users"          # URL path (exact match or prefix with trailing /)
method = "GET"               # HTTP method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
status = 200                 # HTTP status code (100-599)
description = "List users"   # Documentation (optional)
delay = 0                    # Artificial delay in MILLISECONDS before responding (optional)
response = '''               # Response body (typically JSON)
{
  "users": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}
  ]
}
'''

# Custom response headers (optional)
[endpoints.headers]
Content-Type = "application/json"
X-Custom-Header = "custom-value"
Cache-Control = "no-cache"
```

**Endpoint Configuration Details:**

- **`path`** (string, required)
  - URL path to match
  - Exact match: `/api/users` matches only `/api/users`
  - Trailing slash for prefix: `/api/` matches `/api/*`
  - Case-sensitive

- **`method`** (string, default: `"GET"`)
  - HTTP method to respond to
  - Values: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`
  - Only the specified method will receive this response
  - Other methods return 405 Method Not Allowed

- **`status`** (integer, default: `200`)
  - HTTP response status code
  - Common codes:
    - `200` - OK (successful GET, PUT, PATCH)
    - `201` - Created (successful POST)
    - `204` - No Content (successful DELETE)
    - `400` - Bad Request
    - `401` - Unauthorized
    - `403` - Forbidden
    - `404` - Not Found
    - `500` - Internal Server Error
    - `503` - Service Unavailable

- **`delay`** (integer, default: `0`)
  - **Unit: MILLISECONDS**
  - Artificial delay before sending response
  - Useful for testing timeouts, loading states, race conditions
  - `1000` = 1 second, `500` = 0.5 seconds, `3000` = 3 seconds
  - Must be less than `write_timeout` (converted to seconds)
  - Example: `delay = 2000` waits 2 seconds before responding

- **`description`** (string, optional)
  - Human-readable description of the endpoint
  - Logged at startup for documentation
  - Not included in responses

- **`response`** (string, required)
  - Response body content
  - Typically JSON, but can be any format
  - Use triple quotes `'''` for multiline content
  - Supports template variables (see Response Templating)

- **`headers`** (table, optional)
  - Custom HTTP response headers
  - Override defaults or add custom headers
  - `Content-Type` defaults to `application/json` if not specified
  - Common headers:
    - `Content-Type` - MIME type of response
    - `Cache-Control` - Caching directives
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` - CORS headers
    - `X-*` - Custom headers

**Advanced Endpoint Examples:**

```toml
# Simulate a slow API endpoint
[[endpoints]]
path = "/api/slow"
method = "GET"
status = 200
delay = 5000  # 5 second delay in milliseconds
response = '{"message": "This took 5 seconds"}'

# Error response with appropriate status
[[endpoints]]
path = "/api/error"
method = "GET"
status = 500
response = '{"error": "Internal Server Error", "code": "ERR_500"}'

# No content response (common for DELETE)
[[endpoints]]
path = "/api/users/1"
method = "DELETE"
status = 204
response = ""

# CORS-enabled endpoint
[[endpoints]]
path = "/api/cors"
method = "GET"
status = 200
response = '{"data": "CORS enabled"}'

[endpoints.headers]
Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
Access-Control-Allow-Methods = "GET, POST, OPTIONS"

# Large timeout required for slow endpoint
# Make sure server write_timeout > delay (in seconds)
# If delay = 10000 (10 seconds), write_timeout should be >= 15
```

#### GraphQL Configuration

```toml
[graphql]
enabled = true           # Enable/disable GraphQL endpoint
path = "/graphql"        # GraphQL endpoint path (default: /graphql)

[[graphql.types]]
name = "User"
description = "A user in the system"

[graphql.types.fields]
id = "Int!"              # ! means non-nullable
name = "String!"
email = "String!"
age = "Int"              # Nullable field

[[graphql.queries]]
name = "users"
description = "Get all users"
return_type = "[User]"   # Array of User objects
response = '''
[
  {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}
]
'''

[[graphql.mutations]]
name = "createUser"
description = "Create a new user"
return_type = "User"
response = '''
{"id": 2, "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com"}
'''

[graphql.mutations.args]
name = "String!"
email = "String!"
```

### Configuration Loading

The application can load configuration from:
- A single `.toml` file: `-config ./config.toml`
- A directory of `.toml` files: `-config ./configs/` (all `.toml` files will be merged)

Multiple files are useful for organizing endpoints by domain or feature.

**Configuration Merging Rules:**

When loading from a directory:
1. Server settings from the last file override previous values
2. Endpoints are accumulated (all endpoints from all files are registered)
3. GraphQL types, queries, and mutations are accumulated
4. If multiple files define GraphQL config, the last `enabled` and `path` win

**Example Multi-File Setup:**

```
configs/
  ├── server.toml          # Server settings
  ├── users-api.toml       # User endpoints
  ├── products-api.toml    # Product endpoints
  └── graphql.toml         # GraphQL schema
```

## Docker

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build the image
make docker-build

# Run locally
make docker-run

# Or without Make
docker build -t blandmockapi .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/examples:/app/examples blandmockapi
```

### Custom Configuration

```bash
# Mount your own config directory
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/your/configs:/app/config \
  blandmockapi -config /app/config
```

## AWS Deployment

### AWS Lambda

#### Using Docker Image

```bash
# Set your AWS account details
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
export LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME=blandmockapi

# Build and deploy
make docker-lambda-build
make ecr-create
make lambda-deploy-docker

# Or all at once
make quick-lambda
```

#### Using ZIP Package

```bash
# Build Lambda binary
make build-lambda

# Package and deploy
make lambda-deploy LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME=your-function-name
```

#### Lambda Configuration

When creating your Lambda function:
- Runtime: Provide your own (if using Docker) or Go 1.x (if using ZIP)
- Architecture: x86_64
- Environment variables: `CONFIG_PATH=/var/task/config` (optional)
- Handler: `bootstrap` (for custom runtime)
- Timeout: 30 seconds (adjust as needed)
- Memory: 256 MB (adjust based on config size)

Add Function URL or API Gateway to expose the API.

### AWS ECS

# Set environment variables
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export ECS_CLUSTER=your-cluster
export ECS_SERVICE=your-service

# Build and deploy
make deploy-ecs

# Or quick deploy
make quick-ecs
```

### AWS App Runner

```bash
# Set environment variables
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export APPRUNNER_SERVICE_ARN=arn:aws:apprunner:...

# Build and deploy
make deploy-apprunner

# Or quick deploy
make quick-apprunner
```

## Makefile Commands

```bash
make help              # Show all available commands
make build             # Build binary
make run               # Run locally
make test              # Run tests
make docker-build      # Build Docker image

make quick-ecs         # Build and deploy to ECS
make quick-apprunner   # Build and deploy to App Runner
make clean             # Clean build artifacts
```

## Response Templating

Responses support basic variable substitution:

```toml
[[endpoints]]
path = "/api/echo"
method = "GET"
response = '''
{
  "path": "{{path}}",
  "method": "{{method}}",
  "query_param": "{{query.name}}"
}
'''
```

Available variables:
- `{{path}}` - Request path
- `{{method}}` - HTTP method
- `{{query.PARAM}}` - Query parameter value
- `{{body}}` - Request body (for POST/PUT/PATCH)

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for complete configuration examples:
- `rest-endpoints.toml` - Comprehensive REST API examples
- `graphql-schema.toml` - GraphQL schema and resolver examples

## Architecture

  ├── main.go         # Main server
  └── lambda.go       # Lambda-specific handler
internal/
  ├── config/         # Configuration loading
  ├── models/         # Data models

```

## Dependencies

The project uses minimal external dependencies:
- `github.com/BurntSushi/toml` - TOML parsing (industry standard)
- `github.com/graphql-go/graphql` - GraphQL support
- `github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go` - AWS Lambda runtime (optional)
- `github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-go-api-proxy` - Lambda HTTP adapter (optional)

Core HTTP handling uses only Go's standard library.

## Use Cases

- **Development** - Mock external APIs during development
- **Testing** - Create predictable test environments
- **Prototyping** - Quickly prototype API contracts
- **Demos** - Demonstrate frontend applications without backend
- **Contract Testing** - Validate API consumers against expected responses

## Performance

- Startup time: < 1 second
- Memory footprint: ~20MB (base)
- Request latency: < 5ms (without configured delays)
- Binary size: ~15MB (uncompressed)
- Docker image: ~25MB (Alpine-based)

## Limitations

- Path parameters are simple (no complex routing patterns)
- GraphQL responses are static (no dynamic data)
- No authentication/authorization (by design - it's a mock)
- No database or state persistence
- Template variables are basic string replacement
